# FinTech Module 18 Challenge: Blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly web interface


Blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

 - Create a Record Data Class
 - Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
 - Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
 - Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

---

## Usage

To use the Application, run the Streamlit application by using `streamlit run pychain.py`
